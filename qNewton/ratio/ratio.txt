In this repository, q-Krawzcyk method and interval q-Newton method are applied to the ratio of q-Bessel functions (J_\nu(x;q)/J_{\nu-1}(x;q)).
An iteration including arctan (or q-arctan) is also used.
The q-arctan is defined by _2\phi_1 and q-integral.
The ideas came from Numerical Methods for Special Functions (Gil-Segura-Temme, 2007)
