programs for q-special functions and q-series

Thank you for checking my programs.

Programs in this repository are made to calculate q-special functions and q-series with guaranteed accuracy. All q-special functions are computed by calculating infinite q-Pochhammer symbols and q-hypergeometric series with guaranteed accuaracy. 

If you use my programs in publications, please include the following reference.

You do NOT have to inform your usage to me, but I am very glad to hear how my programs helped you.

(Requirements)

Before using my C++ programs, please install these libraries.

kv library -a C++ library for verified numerical computation 

http://verifiedby.me/kv/index-e.html

https://github.com/mskashi/kv

Boost C++ Libraries http://www.boost.org/

If you want to use my MATLAB programs, please install INTLAB.

INTLAB - INTerval LABoratory
The Matlab/Octave toolbox for Reliable Computing
