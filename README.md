# q-special-functions

programs for q-special functions and q-series

Thank you for checking my programs.

Programs in this repository are made to calculate q-special functions and q-series with guaranteed accuracy. All q-special functions are computed by calculating infinite q-Pochhammer symbols and q-hypergeometric series with guaranteed accuaracy. 

Note: The function "complex_nbd" is defined in Heine.hpp. This works like "cintval" in INTLAB.

If you use my programs in publications, please include the following reference.

You do NOT have to inform your usage to me, but I am very glad to hear how my programs helped you.

(Requirements)

Before using my C++ programs, please install these libraries.

kv library -a C++ library for verified numerical computation

https://github.com/mskashi/kv

Boost C++ Libraries http://www.boost.org/

If you want to use my MATLAB programs, please install INTLAB.

INTLAB - INTerval LABoratory
The Matlab/Octave toolbox for Reliable Computing

DISCLAIMER: Extensive tests have been performed to ensure reliability of the algorithms (under Windows 10 with Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and Ubuntu 14.04). However, neither an error-free processor nor an error-free program can be guaranteed.
